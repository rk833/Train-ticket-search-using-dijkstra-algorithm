# Train Ticket Search System

This project implements a train ticket search system that finds optimal routes between railway stations using **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm**.

The railway network is modelled as a weighted graph, where stations are vertices and track connections are edges. The system allows users to search for routes optimised by cost or time and displays detailed journey results.
